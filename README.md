# OpticalFlowA3080ArduinoProcessing

Hey Ho,

Arduino and Processing code for an A3080 or ADNS3080 optical flow sensor.

For circuit layout watch the YouTube video: ‘will be online in a few days’ or the layout.png on GitHub.
Keep in mind that the position of the pins on the A3080 drawing do NOT meet the real situation.

At first, get the Arduino code on your Arduino running. Then read the serial monitor on 38400 baud, to see if you get vector data in a stream.

Then you can try the Processing code. The only problem might occour at the serial port at line 21. Try different ports and Baud rates.
